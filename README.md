## Console V

This was the very first project I started. It proviedes an enviorment to create applications on a terminal like interface inside of a web browser. It provides a level of abstraction and an API to create applications to simulate running on an old computer. You can make an application that provides output to the user, and get input from what the user types in the status bar from their keyboard.

It was made to teach me about OS design, UX, coding abstraction, and computer science concepts. I use the alias `iJD` as the name of the fictional company that releases this product as a general purpose operating system.

There have been 5 major releases, which version 5 (V) the most recent and powerful.

## Console V Development History 

Console V is the newest Console OS from iJD software. Console V is completly 
rebuilt from the ground up using a modern, fast, and more stable kernel. 

Console V uses the latest in Object oriented programming to create a modern 
operating system. 

Legacy Console applications (Console, Console SP, Console 3, Console 4) are
not able to be run on Console V. Legacy applications however only need small 
modifications to run on the new OS. 

What's new:
+ Brand new UI and UX on Console V.
	+ New On button
	+ New always present top bar that displays the version, the time, and the current program 
	+ New left hand information panel to see how your system is running
	+ New input bar that is wider and supports larger type
	+ New system wide font
	+ No more pesky line numbers
	+ Retreive previous commands by using 'arrow up' and 'arrow down'

Features:
+ Password Locking
	+ Set your password so that you don't have to worry about pesky security!
+ Retreive Previous Commands with the 'arrow up' and 'arrow down' keys
+ NEW UI! Check your system status in the left.

Back end:
+ 3 main objects (Display (display), Console (console), System (sys))
